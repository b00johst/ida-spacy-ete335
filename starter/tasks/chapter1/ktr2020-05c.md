<exercise id="21" title="Getting Started">

We have seen that semantic similarity can be quantified in terms of cosinesimilarity of word vectors in a high-dimensional vector space constructed from co-occurrence counts. Based on this idea, which (zero or more) of the following words do you expect to end up close to the word apple in such a vector space?


i. mango  ii. computer   iii. swim    iv. apples


<exact-match correct="mango, computer, apples" right="Bra jobbat!" wrong="Fel svar"/>
